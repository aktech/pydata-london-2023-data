DTSTART;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T090000
DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T103000
DESCRIPTION:sktime is a widely used scikit-learn compatible library for le
 arning with time series. sktime is easily extensible by anyone\, and inter
 operable with the pydata/numfocus stack.\n\nThis tutorial explains how to 
 use sktime for three learning tasks with independent instances of time ser
 ies: time series classification\, regression\, clustering. It also explain
 s their close connection to time series distances\, kernels\, and time ser
 ies alignment\, and how to flexibly combine such estimators to classifiers
 \, regressors\, clusterers with custom distances/kernels or feature extrac
 tion steps.\n\nThis is a continuation of the sktime introductory tutorial 
 at pydata global 2021.

SUMMARY:A dive into Hyperparameter Optimization: by Tanay Agrawal
DTSTART;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T090000
DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T103000
DESCRIPTION:The tutorial aims to introduce the audience to the power of Hy
 perparameter Optimization. It will help them learn\; how using simple pyth
 on libraries one can make a huge difference in their ML model behavior.\n\
 nWe start with understanding the importance of hyperparameters\, and the d
 ifferent distributions they are selected from. We then review some basic m
 ethods of optimizing hyperparameters\, moving on to distributed methods an
 d then to bayesian optimization methods. We'll use these algorithms hands-
 on\, and play around with search spaces. We'll try out packages like Hyper
 opt\, Dask\, Optuna\, to tune hyperparameters.\n\nThis tutorial will help 
 beginner-level ML practitioners and working professionals use these method
 s in their applied ML tasks. They will be able to enhance the model qualit
 y and tune hyperparameters for bulky experiments more effectively.\n\n**Pr
 ior Knowledge Expected** - Basic Python\, a very basic understanding of Ma
 chine learning.\\\n**Good to have** - worked with libraries like scikit-le
 arn(just knowing `model.fit()` should be enough)

SUMMARY:From zero to a working ML system with only Python\, free serverles
 s services and FTI pipelines: by Jim Dowling
DTSTART;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T090000
DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T103000
DESCRIPTION:We will build an operational ML system to predict air quality 
 in London. Instead of a single monolithic ML pipeline\, we will build a mo
 re manageable system as 3 FTI pipelines: a Feature pipeline\, a Training p
 ipeline\, and an Inference pipeline\, connected together by a feature stor
 e. The feature pipeline scrapes new data and provides historical data (air
  quality observations and weather forecasts)\, The  training pipeline prod
 uces a model using the air quality observations and features. The inferenc
 e pipeline takes weather forecasts and predicts air quality for London\, v
 isualized in a UI. The system will be hosted on free serverless services -
  Modal\, Hugging Face Spaces\, and Hopsworks. It will be a continually imp
 roving ML system that keeps collecting more data\, making better predictio
 ns\, and provides a hindcast with insights into its historical performance

DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T123000
DESCRIPTION:Active Learning is a powerful technique in the field of data s
 cience that enables efficient use of labelling resources. In this 90-minut
 e-long hands-on tutorial\, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to 
 apply basic Active Learning techniques for a document classification probl
 em.\n\nThe tutorial will begin with an introduction to Active Learning\, f
 ollowed by a brief discussion of its cost and time savings benefits. Next\
 , we will implement clustering to select the first batch of training data.
  Then\, we will train a document classification model and analyse fundamen
 tal Active Learning concepts such as diversity\, isolation\, and model unc
 ertainty. We will compare different metrics to select the best points for 
 annotation.\n\nFinally\, we will evaluate the model's performance and comp
 are the results of Active Learning with random annotation. Throughout the 
 tutorial\, attendees will have the opportunity to work on their implementa
 tion and receive assistance.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial\, attendees wi
 ll better understand the principles of Active Learning and how to apply th
 em to their own supervised learning problems\, enabling them to make more 
 efficient use of their labelling resources.

SUMMARY:Hands-on Intro to developing Explainability for Recommendation Sys

DTSTART;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T133000
DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T150000
DESCRIPTION:Over the last decade\, the commercial use of recommendation en
 gines/systems by business has grown substantially\, enabling the flexible 
 and accurate recommendation of items/services to users. Examples of popula
 r recommenders include (to name a few) movies\, videos and books recommend
 ation engines offered by Netflix\, Youtube and Amazon respectively. \n\nIn
  general\, most recommender systems are typically “black-box” algorith
 ms trained to provide inference of relevant items to users using technique
 s such as collaborative or content-based filtering models or hybrid models
 . The algorithms used in these systems are broadly opaque\, thus making th
 e predicted recommendations lack full interpretability/explainability. Mak
 ing recommenders explainable is very essential\, as they try to provide tr
 ansparency and address the question of why were particular items recommend
 ed by the engine to users/system designers. \n\nOver the last few years th
 ere has been a growing area of research and development in explainable rec
 ommendation systems. Explainable recommendations systems are generally cla
 ssified as Post-hoc (i.e. explainability is done post-recommendation) or I
 ntrinsic (explainability is integrated into the recommender model) approac
 hes. This workshop will provide a hands-on implementation of some of these
  approaches.

DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230602T170000
DESCRIPTION:Object detection is arguably the most common Computer Vision t
 ask. It is applied to images and videos across various domains. However\, 
 action recognition is a tad different from object detection because it can
  be difficult to tell certain actions from a single image. It is hard to t
 ell if a door is being opened or closed or tell what martial art technique
  is being executed from an image.\n\nIn this tutorial\, the MMAction2 fram
 ework will be used to train an action recognition model to detect what Jud
 o throws are being performed in videos. While it will be fun seeing Machin
 e Learning techniques applied to Martial Arts\, the knowledge and techniqu
 es applied can easily be generalized to other action recognition tasks whe
 re simple object detection does not suffice.

 bility\, they can be used not only to generate data\, but also for many ot
 her tasks\, e.g. clustering\, dimensionality reduction and transfer learni
 ng. \n\nDespite their popularity\, their application is usually advertised
  mostly for applications with static tabular (e.g. for recommender systems
 ) and image data (e.g. for computer vision tasks). With this talk we will 
 try to shed some light on a less well-known area of application\, namely t
 he use of AEs with time series data. After a brief introduction on AEs we 
 will highlight challenges to their application in the time-series domain w
 ith a particular focus on clustering\, features extraction and transfer le
 arning. \n\nThe talk is for everyone with an interest in deep learning\, t

 ed machine learning (deep learning in particular) and time series analysis
  would be beneficial\, the talk will be delivered in a format accessible t

DESCRIPTION:Software plays an increasingly critical role in research and o
 ver the past decade this has seen Research Software Engineering (RSE) emer
 ge as a distinct role within both the academic and commercial research sec
 tors. [First coined](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-bri
 ef-history-research-software-engineers-0) at a community workshop in 2012\
 , "Research Software Engineer" gave a name to those researchers who had be
 en spending most of their time writing software and brought together a com
 munity to establish a dedicated career pathway for the role within UK acad
 emia.\n\nOver the past decade the demand for RSEs has grown rapidly and th
 e role has become well established in both academia and industry\, with th
 e number of RSE roles and RSE groups expanding rapidly year on year\, sust
 ainable career pathways for RSEs in place at many organisations\, and a [p
 rofessional society](https://society-rse.org/) for the role established. R
 ecent years have also seen the emergence of other related Research Technol
 ogy roles such as Research Data Scientists\, Research Data Stewards\, Rese
 arch Application Managers and Community Managers.\n\nIn this talk Martin w
 ill give an overview of Research Software Engineering and related roles\, 
 and will examine the similarities and differences between these roles and 
 their counterparts outside the research sector. Martin will describe the j
 ourney the community has made from naming a new role\, to establishing a c
 ommunity of practice\, to building a sustainable new profession.

 xonomy. By applying this algorithm to a dataset of scraped online job adve
 rts\, we are then able to find skill similarities amongst occupations\, an

DESCRIPTION:We're in a new era of dataframe development.  Libraries like A
 rrow\, Polars\, DuckDB\, Vaex\, Modin\, and others stretch the bounds of p
 erformance on what we think can be done with tabular data in Python.  Thes
 e systems have great benchmarking results and generate significant buzz on
  social media.\n\nPandas\, the community favorite\, is also innovating\, a
 lthough with less buzz.  Structural improvements like Arrow data types\, c
 opy on write\, and more bring the world's most popular dataframe library (
 55% of Python users) into significantly better performance and memory use.
   Additionally Dask\, a parallel computing library developed closely with 
 Pandas\, has also added new features in the last year\, like memory-stable
  shuffling\, task queueing\, and with recent experiments in query optimiza

SUMMARY:From correlations to causality in machine learning– a gentle gui

DTSTART;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T110000
DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T114000
DESCRIPTION:Today most conventional ML systems look to exploit correlation
 s in data in order to draw inferences. However as we learned back in schoo
 l Statistics class\, correlation is not  causation. So when you need to kn
 ow the ‘why’ behind a particular prediction\, or why A outperforms B i
 n an experiment\, then relying on correlations is insufficient.  Furthermo
 re some ML models are build purely for explainability and insight purposes
  rather than predictions\, in order to understand how the world works so w
 e could potentially make some kind of policy change\, e.g. What if we had 
 chosen a different strategy or tactic – would the outcome have been diff
 erent\, and if so\, by how much? To answer these kinds of questions\, you 
 need to delve into the world of causality. \n\nThis talk is a gentle (and 
 occasionally entertaining) introduction to the interdisciplinary field of 
 causality and how it is starting to impact machine learning. You will lear
 n what kinds of questions causal inference can answer\, and how it can add
 ress some of the limitations of current explainable ML methods\, under cer
 tain conditions. I draw upon use-cases drawn from financial services and m
 arketing\, and  I will show a short practical example of how combining hum
 an domain knowledge (intuitively via Graphical Causal Models) along with y
 our data can sometimes unlock insights not recoverable by purely data driv
 en approaches.

DESCRIPTION:Extracting data from web pages is a problem which is not so we
 ll covered and researched compared to image or text classification\, objec
 t detection or named entity recognition. But this problem is extremely exc
 iting to look into and rewarding to work on\, because web pages can be rep
 resented in so many ways: as a screenshot of a page\, as it's text\, as an
  HTML tree\, as a sequence of elements with discrete and continuous proper
 ties\, and in other ways. This leads to many diverse approaches\, which of
 ten combine different input types and ways of data representation inside o
 ne model. In this talk we will explore several intriguing approaches for w
 eb data extraction\, and see how one can come up with novel approaches and
  grow your model according to the task at hand.\nThis talk is intended for
  anyone with interest in neural networks. I hope it gives you inspiration 
 and intuition for building deep learning models tailored to the structure 
 of your data. This is applicable not only to web information extraction\, 
 but also to document extraction and other domains with structured text or 
 image inputs.

SUMMARY:"Unstructured" terabyte-scale textual data processing in a distrib
 uted cluster: by Jay Chia
DTSTART;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T114500
DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T122500
DESCRIPTION:ChatGPT has reignited worldwide interest in text data\, captur
 ing the imaginations of thousands of developers\, but how do we actually b
 uild large scale production pipelines for working with and processing this
  highly unstructured data?\n\nSQL is a great language for simple data moda
 lities that fits in a database table\, but when it comes to complex "unstr
 uctured" data\, it is Python that really shines. In this talk\, we show ho
 w easy it is to go from data storage to querying and processing large amou
 nts of unstructured data using modern Python open-sourced tooling such as 
 Ray\, Daft and HuggingFace models.

DTSTART;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T150000
DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T154000
DESCRIPTION:PyScript brings the full PyData stack in the browser\, opening
  up to unprecedented use cases for interactive data-intensive applications
 . In this scenario\, the web browser becomes a ubiquitous computing platfo
 rm\, operating within a (nearly) _zero-installation_ & _server-less_ envir
 onment.\n\nIn this talk\, we will explore how to create full-fledged inter
 active front-end machine learning applications using PyScript. We will div
 e into the the main features of the PyScript platform (e.g. _built-in Java
 script integration_ and  _local modules_ )\, discussing _new_ data & desig
 n patterns (e.g. _loading heterogeneous data in the browser_)\, required t
 o adapt and to overcome the limitations imposed by the new operating envir
 onment (i.e. the browser).

DESCRIPTION:This will be a gentle introduction to the world of clinical ga
 it analysis and how your gait (a.k.a the way you walk) is a digital biomar
 ker for predicting physical and cognitive health. We will talk about digit
 al biomarker engineering from unconventional sources of data (footstep sou
 nds for example). To demonstrate a real life application\, I will briefly 
 mention how the R&D team at MiiCare uses acoustic machine learning for fal
 l risk assessment for older adults living alone at home and care homes acr
 oss the UK. \n\nYou should join this talk if you are interested in digital
  health\, digital biomarker engineering and applications of AI in social c
 are.

SUMMARY:Synthetic data: what is it and why do we need it?: by Zhaozhi Qian
DTSTART;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T154500
DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T162500
DESCRIPTION:One of the biggest barriers to machine learning and data analy
 tics is the difficulty to access high quality data. Synthetic data has bee
 n widely recognized as a promising remedy to this problem. It allows shari
 ng\, augmenting and de-biasing data for building performant and socially r
 esponsible ML systems. In this talk\, I will overview the significant prog
 ress in the theory and methodology of synthetic data over the past five ye
 ars. I will also introduce the open-source library\, [Synthcity](https://g
 ithub.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity)\, which implements an array of cuttin
 g-edge synthetic data generators to address data scarcity\, privacy\, and 
 bias. The participants will walk away with a deeper understanding of the t
 heory and practice of synthetic data\, an understanding of when which meth
 ods apply (or do not apply) to their specific use case\, and be ready to a
 pply them in hackathons\, competitions\, and their day-to-day work.

SUMMARY:Deploying Real-Time Machine Learning Models Using Serverless AWS: 
 by Pedro Tabacof
DTSTART;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T163000
DTEND;TZID="UTC+01:00":20230604T171000
DESCRIPTION:In this presentation\, I will show how to use AWS Lambda and A
 PI Gateway to deploy real-time machine learning models developed in Python
 . I will use these tools to create a serverless web endpoint and serve mod
 el predictions with high availability/scalability. These tools provide a r
 elatively simple and cost-effective solution for data scientists and machi
 ne learning engineers looking to deploy models without the hassle of manag
 ing servers and without needing to rely on third parties. I will cover pot
 ential pitfalls to be aware of\, such as Lambda's cold start delays and me
 mory limitations. Through code examples and practical tips\, attendees wil
 l gain a solid understanding of how to use serverless AWS to deploy and se
 rve their own machine learning models at scale.
